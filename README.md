# CNC Rapid Quote (Python Version)

Automated quotation system for CNC machining built in Python.

## My Contributions
- Designed and implemented the first version of the CNC quotation estimator fully in Python.
- Used input parameters like material, thickness, cutting length, and machine time to calculate costs.
- Integrated material feed rate data and default values from CSV files.
- Generated quick cost estimates for CNC laser cutting jobs.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Data: CSV files (material feed rates, default values)
- Libraries: pandas, math, os (basic Python libraries)

## Files
- main - Sachin Industries.py (estimator logic)
- Default_Values.csv (default parameters)
- MS_CU_Feed_Rate.csv (feed rates for MS/CU materials)
- SS_AL_Feed_Rate.csv (feed rates for SS/AL materials)
- sample files/ (sample CNC job input files)

## Note
This repo represents the *initial Python prototype* of CNC Rapid Quote, which was later extended into a full-stack webÂ application.
